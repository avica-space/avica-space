# Welcome to avica-agentur 🚀

Hi there! I’m **Maiko Avilés Caso**, the developer and founder of **avica-agentur**.

While avica-agentur is a dedicated one-man operation, I am driven by the goal of delivering high-quality, tailor-made web solutions. After a period of focusing on internal development and refining my technical foundations, I am now officially increasing my presence here on GitHub to showcase my work and connect with the community.

### 🛠 My Expertise & Philosophy
I specialize in **custom full-stack web development** with a strong focus on security and performance. 

What sets my work apart is a **"Vanilla-First" approach**: I build my applications **without relying on third-party libraries, external frameworks, or ready-made CMS systems** (like WordPress). 

**Why I code this way:**
*   **Performance:** No overhead or unnecessary code bloat—only what is actually needed.
*   **Security:** By writing my own logic, I maintain full control over the codebase and minimize vulnerabilities from third-party dependencies.
*   **Independence:** My projects are built to last, free from the cycle of breaking updates in external plugins or libraries.

### 💻 Tech Stack
I use a reliable, time-tested stack to build everything from scratch:
*   **Frontend:** Clean, responsive layouts using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, with dynamic functionality powered by **Vanilla JavaScript**.
*   **Backend:** Robust server-side logic and secure processes developed in **PHP**.
*   **Databases:** Scalable data architecture using **MySQL** and **MariaDB**.

### 🏗 Key Features
Most of my projects include:
*   Custom-built **Membership Areas**.
*   Secure **User Registration** and authentication systems.
*   Deeply integrated **Database Management** tailored to specific business needs.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect
I am always open to new challenges, feedback, or professional inquiries. Whether you are looking for a dedicated partner for a project or just want to talk about "pure" coding, feel free to reach out!

*   **Owner:** Maiko Avilés Caso
*   **Focus:** Custom Full-Stack Development (No-Framework / No-CMS)
*   **Status:** 2026 - Open for new projects and collaborations!
